## Key:

### Keywords:

- **Access:** Access refers to those who can view source code.
- **Higher Level Access:** This refers to those who can modify source code.
- **Admin Level Access:** This refers to those who may change organization and repository settings, manage other employees, and delete or create source code.  These employees are able to approve pull requests done by Higher Level Access employees.
- **Verified:** Personell with a status that shows them as verified are employees of WD_Bypass.
- **Alpha Team:** Alpha team refers to the team of developers and testers that were part of WD_Bypass when it was initially founded.
- **Moderator:** Moderates one or multiple of the official WD_Bypass socials.
- **Delta Team:** Team of moderators that moderate user accounts.
- **Beta Team:** Team of employees who oversee departments such as moderation, support, and public contact.
- **Omega Team:** Team of employees who create posts on official WD_Bypass socials, interact with the public, and are used in trailer videos.
- **Gamma Team:** Team of employees who can take the place of anybody if they need a break/no longer associate for whatever reason.
- **Echo Team:** The WD_Bypass Legal Team.
- **Aria Team:** The team that works on art, music, and other creative productions.
- **Rho Team:** The team assigned to reviewing, summarizing, and upkeeping bug reports and the bug part of the update tracker.
- **Solar Team:** The team that manages finances and contact with charities.
- **M.O.S.S.** The game development group owned by WD_Bypass.
- **Employee:** As WD_Bypass is a nonprofit, and does not make money off of public products, this term is used in place of unpaid employee.  No money is made off of general use WD_Bypass products, and nobody associated with WD_Bypass uses them to gain profit. Money may be made off of APIs hosted by WD_Bypass, certain specific services we offer, and potentially hosting of servers, but this will go to production costs, hosting costs, and any monetary requirements that WD_Bypass may have.  If it is not needed or in an expected emergency buffer just in case, remaining money will be donated to charities such as the Red Cross, The YMCA, Feeding America, and many more.
