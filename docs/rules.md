# RULES

1. Distribution of the patches is STRICTLY FORBIDDEN.
2. Any adverse effects/misuse of the patches is completely the fault of the user, not the devteam.
3. Any broken rules result in a ban, and loss of the files. Punishment for keeping the files is still in process, and will be here when decided.
