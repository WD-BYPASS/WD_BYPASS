          <h2>Omnipotence, Crucifix, and the WD_Bypass patch ecosystem:</h2>
          <h3>Omnipotence:</h3>
          <p>Omnipotence is the general use Python based patch.  It will be integrated into the main WD_Toolkit once more products are made.</p>
          <h3>Crucifix:</h3>
          <p>Crucifix is the batch file/terminal command used in Omnipotence, but standalone.  It has no plans of distribution, but that may change.</p>
          <h3>Ecosystem:</h3>
          <p>These are beta patches used for specific exe files. They weren't optimal or useful at all.</p>
          <h2>KCSgate Combat Kit:</h2>
          <p>The KCSgate Combat Kit is a work in progress product that may be used to maliciously comply to the device policy, that may pertain to distribution of devices such as roatry phones, gramophones, and typewriters, for example.</p>
